# API_Testing-REST-APIs-
This is my automation and manual testing reports which I have worked in APPSUCCESSORS pvt. Ltd.
In this company I have to do the following tasks for API Testing:-
* I have tested SIRONA Mobile Application from playstore using its logs and usb debugging.
* I have used FIDDLER CLASSIC web Debugging tools for both WEB and APP testing and generating logs.
* Now my last task is to check whether the APIs are working correctly or not by automating using python scripts that is mentioned.
* After that I have created Report for that testing.
